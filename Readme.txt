# Image Text Recognition with EasyOCR

This repository contains a Python project for extracting text from images using EasyOCR. The project includes techniques for detecting and recognizing text written in various colors, including white text on light backgrounds. The text is highlighted with bounding boxes on the image, and the processed images are displayed within a Jupyter notebook.

## Features

- Text Extraction: Uses EasyOCR for extracting text from images.
- Bounding Boxes: Draws bounding boxes around recognized text regions in the image.
- Visualization: Displays the original and processed images with bounding boxes directly in a Jupyter notebook using `matplotlib`.
